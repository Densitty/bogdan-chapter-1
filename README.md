Here, we are reviewing all the JavaScript basics, where we learnt that everything in JavaScript is an object.
There are two types of variables; 
  *Primitive variable types
  *Reference variable types
Primitive data types are numbers, strings, boolean, null and undefined. This hold a place in our machine memory directly
For reference data types, we do not access them in the machine memory directly, but access them through a pointer. It is the pointer that now goes into the memory to fetch these variables.(More on this will be committed as a note for reference)
